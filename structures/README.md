## Have fun!
If you find this code useful, I will be glad if you use it in your GPL3-compatible licensed project.

**"Why GPL-3. Author, are you too proud?"**
> Nope. It's just that I'm fighting for free software, and any possibility that someone else is using my code on a project that people, myself included, will have to pay for is unacceptable.
> My code is neither perfect nor revolutionary. But the world is crazy, you know

Any help and criticism is greatly appreciated.
